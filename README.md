!!! This is alpha currently. Don't depend on the interface not changing!

Individual modules to put together to make synths, with some modules being full-fledged synths in their own right.

Works more like a modular analog synth for maximum flexibility but with converters to work with the more rigid world of midi.

Also includes a port of [libfmsynth](https://github.com/Themaister/libfmsynth/blob/master/src/fmsynth.c).
